# CMS Skeleton Theme

This theme has the very barebones you need to get started with a blank theme from scratch.

There are no styles, no content, and no modules. Ready for you as a fresh slate.

It only contains the following:

- theme settings
- theme details
- folder structure
- base layout needed for dnd (drag and drop) editor
- basic page `<head>` info to use page details from dnd editor
- css reset
- variable definitions
- imports registered
- example custom font definition
